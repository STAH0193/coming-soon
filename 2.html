				For me, the TV show Digimon was a really big deal growig up with. It felt way more relevant than Pok√©mon as a kid growing up around the birth of modern internet. If you don't know, the show was an anime about kids who weren chosen as Digital Guardians. They came across these wireless devices that connected to computers and teleported them into the Digital World. They were the Digi Destines, who worked with good digital monsters to protect the Digital world from evil. Of course, there were other kids their age who were the antogonist, working for the evils of the web. And of course, these antagonists were just screwed up kids with personal and family problems that later resolve these issues to help the Digi Destined protect the Digital World. Altogether, there were eight seasons, each one with new plots and new technologies. </br></br>

	My generation grew up with the internet. We are the Digi Destined. We're on the web all the time, be it social media, forums, self education, news search and so on. We're constantly changing the web and hence shaping how this digital world is. Just like the the show Digimon, our job on the internet is to rid of evil. There are billions of digital warriors across the world, adding their personal data to the web each day. In the year 2000, there were 361 million internet users online. This number is exponentially growing with a checkpoint of 1,967 million users sited in 2010. Just like the spacial universe, the digital universe is at a constant expansion. Even with the fear of net-neutrality and mainstream formatting from CMS pages (ie WordPress, Tumblr, SquareSpace), there are still millions of homebrewed internet sites and activities that go undocumented. </br></br>

	We need to be aware of our digital footprint
