Mobile advertising revenue represented approximately 87 percent of advertising revenue for Q2.</br></br>
1.32 billion people on average who <b class="facebook">log onto Facebook daily</b> active users (Facebook DAU) <b class="facebook">for</b> June 2017, which represents a 17 percent increase year over year (Source: Facebook as 07/26/17) The Implication: A <b class="facebook">huge</b> and vastly growing number of Facebook users are active and consistent in their visits to the site, making them a promising audience for your marketing <b class="facebook">efforts</b>.

In Europe, over 307 million people are on Facebook. (Source: Search Engine Journal) The Takeaway: <b class="facebook">This isn’t</b> just a U.S. phenomenon – a <b class="facebook">worldwide</b> market is available via <b class="facebook">Facebook</b>.</br></br>
Age 25 to 34, at 29.7% of users, <b class="facebook">is</b> the most common age demographic. (Source:Emarketer 2012) What this means for you: This is the prime target demographic for many <b class="facebook">businesses</b>’ marketing efforts, and <b class="facebook">you have the chance</b> to engage these key consumers on Facebook.
