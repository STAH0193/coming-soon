<p style="font-size: 2em">I know there's something in the wake of your smile. </br>
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yea. </br>
You've built a love but that love falls apart. </br>
Your little piece of heaven turns too dark.</br></br>

Listen to your heart when he's calling for you. </br>
Listen to your heart there's nothing else you can do. </br></br>

I don't know where you're going and I don't know why, </br>
But listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye.</br>
Sometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhile. </br>
The precious moments are all lost in the tide, yea. </br>
They're swept away and nothing is what is seems, </br>
The feeling of belonging to your dreams.</br></br>

Listen to your heart when he's calling for you. </br>
Listen to your heart there's nothing else you can do. </br></br>

I don't know where you're going and I don't know why, </br>
But listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye.</br>
And there are voices that want to be heard. </br>
So much to mention but you can't find the words. </br>
The sense of magic, the beauty that's been </br>
When love was wilder than the wind.</br></br>

Listen to your heart when he's calling for you. </br>
Listen to your heart there's nothing else you can do. </br></br>

I don't know where you're going and I don't know why, </br>
But listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye.</br></br>

Listen to your heart when he's calling for you. </br>
Listen to your heart there's nothing else you can do. </br></br>

I don't know where you're going and I don't know why, </br>
But listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye.</br>
