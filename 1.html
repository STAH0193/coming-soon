			Those are my pants. I swear to god those are my pants. No, seriously, those are my pants. I got those pants with mom. Don't act like these are yours because they're mine. I want my pants back. Give me back my pants. They don't even look that good on you. We're not even the same size. Those are my pants. Just give me my pants back. You're being so annoying I'm telling mom. Mom was with me when I got those pants. Mom bought those pants for me. Go get your own pair with mom or something. Stop it! You're being a ***** Just give them back, give them back. They're the only pair that have ever fit me right. those are mine. Give. Them. Back. I'm gonna call dad. I'm calling dad. "Dad, Susie is wearing my pants. I got these jeans at the gap with mom at Ridgedale. Susie is wearing them and won't give them back. No, I'm sure they're mine, I know what my pants look like. I got to go, talk to you later, love you". Suusie give me my stuff. That's my shirt! You're taking all my clothes. You're acting like this is your closet. You're acting like you can just go through my **** while I'm gone. It's still my room even when I'm not home. This is my room. Get out of my room. Give me back my clothes! You have so many clothes in your room. You have too many clothes. These are my own clothes. I hate it when you go through my stuff. It feels so invasive. This is still my space when I'm gone. Those jeans don't even fit you, they're too big. Mom bought me those Gap jeans last fall before going back to school. You don't need my jeans. These are my jeans. Get your own pair of pants.
